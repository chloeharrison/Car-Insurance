                        <h2>What is Learner Drivers Insurance?</h2>
                        <p>When you're learning to drive it's important to get as much experience behind the wheel as you possibly can. Driving lessons with an instructor are the best way to get plenty of hands-on experience but they can be costly and it's often a case of one-per-week.Lots of people choose to be added to a parent's or family member's policy to get some extra practice between official lessons.</p>
                        <p>The insurance works in addition to any cover already in place on the car and you can choose instant cover from two hours to 90 days.As a learner driver, you would need to be accompanied by a full licence holder aged 21 or over who has held their full UK licence for three years or longer at all times and the cover finishes as soon as the hard part's done and you've passed your test.</p>

                        <p>Car insurance can pay out if your car is stolen, vandalised, catches on fire or if you are involved in an accident. It also protects you against any damage you cause to the public, their property or other road users.You only need to claim on your policy when an accident is your fault. If another driver is to blame their insurance should pay instead. There are three levels of car insurance, these are:                        </p>

                        <h2>What is Multi Car Insurance?</h2>
                        <p>Multi car insurance is designed for households with more than one car, and you can usually cover up to a maximum of five cars on one policy. You can think of it as a family car insurance policy, where each additional vehicle on the policy earns a further multi car discount from the insurer. While some insurers will only cover cars registered to the same address, the best multi car insurance policies will also allow you to cover cars driven by your immediate family, even if they live elsewhere.</p>

                        <p>A car warranty (also called mechanical breakdown insurance) is a type of insurance policy that protects you from the cost of fixing certain mechanical problems and electrical faults. At their most simplistic, car warranty policies will cover basic issues to do with the engine and transmission system.</p>

                        <p>If you are a young driver or you’ve recently passed your test, you could be facing an eye-watering quote for your car insurance.Black box insurance works when your car is fitted with a small ‘black box’ device, about the size of a smartphone, which records speed, distance travelled and the time of day or night that you are on the road.The device also assesses your driving style by monitoring braking and cornering. It will also record the types of road on which you typically travel, and the times of day and night you tend to drive, to build up a comprehensive profile of you as a driver.</p>

                        <p>Multi-car insurance policies are designed for people who have more than one car in the family.Instead of having to keep track of different policies and renewal dates for different cars, a multi-car policy bundles all the policies with one insurer so they’re held together separately or combined into a single policy that renews at the same time.</p>

                            If you’ve had a crash, you’ll need to make a claim. You’ll need to get in touch with both the police and your insurance company and inform them as fully as possible as to what happened.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your insurance company will give you a form to fill out that you should return to them along with any photos you can take of any damage caused.

                            If you do have penalty points on your driving licence, then there will be consequences for your car insurance. When taking out a new policy, it’s important to be honest with the insurer. You can expect your insurance premium to increase, and you may have to renew your insurance if you receive points while already covered. Some insurers also charge more for covering drivers convicted of specific offences, for example speeding or drink driving.

                            A no-claims bonus (NCB), sometimes called a no-claims discount, is a car insurance discount recognised by insurance providers. It's a count of the number of years you haven't made a claim on your car insurance policy.So for every year you drive without making a claim on your policy, you gain a no-claims bonus.
